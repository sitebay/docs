Email Addresses and Contact Information

Yo, when you sign up with Site Bay, the email and contact info you drop with us? That's super important. It's how we hit you up with updates, billing, and all that good stuff. So, make sure you keep it real and up to date, alright?

Passwords

Now, let's talk about keeping things locked tight. Your passwords? They're like the keys to your digital kingdom. Here's the deal:

Strong Passwords: Make 'em tough to guess. Mix it up with letters, numbers, and symbols. And don't even think about using "password" as your password. Come on now.
Mix It Up: The password for your Site Bay account should be different from your WordPress admin passwords. Like, if one key opens every lock, that's just asking for trouble.
We Donâ€™t Hold the Keys: For real, we don't keep a copy of your passwords. That means if you forget your WordPress admin password, it's a bit of a situation. We can't just pull it out of a hat for you.
Suspect Something? Change It: If you ever feel like someone's messing with your account without your say-so, change that password, pronto. Don't wait.
Setting and Resetting Your Password

Setting Up: When you create your account or a new site, you'll set up a password. Remember the rules above and keep it secure.

Forgot Your Password? It happens to the best of us. If it's your Site Bay account, you can reset it through the login page. For your WordPress site, you'll need to use the "Lost your password?" link on the login screen of your WordPress site.

Security Tips
Keep Your Info Private: Don't go sharing your password. And definitely don't write it down where folks can find it.
Update Regularly: Change your passwords from time to time. It's like keeping your security fresh.
Use a Password Manager: These apps keep your passwords locked down but easy for you to access when you need 'em.

Managing your accounts and passwords is key to keeping your online presence secure. Take it seriously, and if you've got questions, Site Bay's support is here to help you out. Stay safe, stay secure.
