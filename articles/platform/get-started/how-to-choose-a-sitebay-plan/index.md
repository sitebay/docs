Site Bay offers four plan types: Micro, Starter, Business, and Enterprise. All our cool features? You get 'em with any plan you pick. But let's break it down so you can choose what's best for your vibe.

When you're looking at plans, think about how many folks you expect to visit your site each month and how much stuff (like photos and videos) you want to store. This guide's here to walk you through Site Bay's plans, show you what each one's good for, and help you pick the right one.

Feeling like you need to switch things up later? No sweat. You can change your plans anytime on My Site Bay. Check out the Change a Plan tutorial if you need a hand.

Choosing a Plan for Your WordPress Sites

Both our Micro and Starter plans are cool for one site. Got more? You might wanna look at our Business plan or something bigger.

1. Micro

Pick the Micro plan if your site's just chilling with light traffic.

Use Cases

Small blogs that are just getting started
2. Starter

This one's great for small businesses or personal sites making a bit more noise.

Use Cases
Local businesses getting the word out
Blogs sharing what's up
Review sites telling you what's hot and what's not
3. Business

Stepping up to Business means you're getting serious.

Use Cases
Small to medium businesses growing their reach
Blogs that are buzzing with visitors
Handling multiple sites without breaking a sweat
4. Enterprise

Go big or go home, right? Enterprise is for those wanting the VIP treatment.

Use Cases
Businesses that need us on speed dial
Big blog networks handling serious traffic
