SiteBay also offers a number of resources you can refer to when troubleshooting your WordPress site's theme and plugin issues. These issues are generally outside the scope of SiteBay Support, and the other resources SiteBay provides can help you find solutions for your questions.

-   **SiteBay Tutorials & Tutorials:** The [Tutorials](/support/) library has troubleshooting tutorials as well:

  - The [Troubleshooting](/support/troubleshooting/troubleshooting/) quick start tutorial provides answers for common server connectivity and management issues.

  - The [SiteBay Beginner's Tutorial](/support/platform/billing-and-support/sitebay-beginners-tutorial/) displays a curated list of the most frequently asked questions from SiteBay customers.

  - The [Quick Answers](/support/quick-answers/) section offers short tutorials with fast answers.
