Why Should You Care?

Understand Your Audience: By watching how real people navigate your site, you can understand what they like and what they don’t. This means you can make changes that your audience will love.

Improve Your Site: See where people are dropping off or what's making them click. Use that knowledge to tweak your site, keep people around longer, and maybe even boost your sales or sign-ups.
