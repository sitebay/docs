PostHog insights are the core components of dashboards

## Overview

Insights in PostHog display your data through various information visualization components. These components include line graphs, bar charts, pie charts, funnels, retention tables, and other user analytics tools.

## Key Components of PostHog insights

### Trends

"Trends" can help you identify how users interact with your product. It can show you overall event volume, unique users across several time frames, and break down the actions/events by properties.

### Funnels

Funnels are great for visualizing the steps your users take in your application or website. With funnels, you can see where your users are dropping off, and thus take actions to improve user retention and conversion rate.

### Retention

The retention tool helps you understand how often users come back to your app after their initial visit. It shows you the behaviours of both new and returning users, enabling you to make decisions to boost user retention.
