This guide walks you through using Site Bot on my.sitebay.org, an intuitive tool for efficient website management and deployment, with unlimited use for ChatGPT Plus subscribers.

## Open the Site Bot Side Panel
Before you can leverage Site Bot's powerful features, you need to access it. Navigate to https://chat.openai.com/g/g-OUIbMa4mL-site-bot-by-site-bay and open the Site Bot side panel. This is your command center for interacting with Site Bot and where all the magic begins.

## Make a Site with Site Bot
Site Bot enables you to deploy new sites swiftly. Start by telling Site Bot the domain you prefer, like `mysite.org`, and ensure the CNAME is pointed correctly to `washington.sitebay.org`. Site Bot will then guide you through the process, asking for necessary information such as the WordPress admin username, password, and blog name. It's a seamless process that takes minutes to complete.

## Buy a Plan with Site Bot
As your site grows, you might need more resources or features. Site Bot facilitates easy plan upgrades. Just inform Site Bot about your desire to upgrade your team's plan, and it will provide a secure checkout link for transitioning to the Business Plan or any other preferred option.

## Post Content on Your SiteBay WordPress Site
Site Bot isn't just about managing the technical side of your site; it can also help you with content management. For example, you can request Site Bot to post a story about a dog named Sammy, complete with images, tags, and categories, on your WordPress site.

## Get Installed Plugins
Wondering which plugins are currently enhancing your site? Ask Site Bot to fetch a list of installed plugins, providing you with information to manage or update them as needed.

## Restore Your Website
Mishaps happen, but Site Bot can help you swiftly recover. Specify a date and time for restoration, and Site Bot will handle the rest, ensuring your site's wp-content is up-to-date while pruning any unnecessary files.

## Grab a Link to The Latest Session Recording
