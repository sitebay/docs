## Pay Your Bill

When an invoice is generated, the default payment method on the account is automatically charged within a few hours. See [View and Change the Default Payment Method](/docs/products/platform/billing/guides/payment-methods/#view-and-change-the-default-payment-method) for instructions on changing the default payment method.
