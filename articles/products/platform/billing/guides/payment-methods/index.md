See [Adding a New Payment Method](/docs/products/platform/billing/guides/payment-methods/#add-a-new-payment-method) for instructions on adding a new payment method to your account.

## Add a New Payment Method

New payment methods can be added to an account through the My Site Bay. Up to **6 payment methods** can be active on an account at any given time, including multiple credit cards, Google Pay methods.

1.  Navigate to the **Billing Info** page in the [My Site Bay](https://my.sitebay.org/account/billing) (see [Accessing Billing Information](/docs/products/platform/billing/guides/access-billing/)).

1.  If adding a credit card directly, it must match the account's billing contact information and address. Review the **Billing Contact** section and edit it as necessary (see [Update Billing Contact Information](/docs/products/platform/billing/guides/update-billing-contact-info/)).

1.  In the **Payment Method** section, click the *Add Payment Method* link. This opens the **Add Payment Method** panel.

1.  Complete the form according to the payment method you wish to add.

    **To pay with a credit card:** Enter the credit card number, expiration date, and the security code (CVV) of the new card. Then click **Add Credit Card**.

    A $1.00 authorization hold may be placed on your credit card by your banking institution when our payment processor tests the validity of the card. This is normal behavior and does not result in a charge on your card.

    **To pay with Google Pay:** Click the **Google Pay** icon/button to open Google's own Google Pay form. Log in to your Google account and select the payment method you wish to use. Press **continue** (or otherwise complete the form) to be taken back to the My Site Bay.

1.  After the payment method is added, it will be assigned as the *default* payment method and will be used for future recurring payments. This can be changed by following the instructions within the [Viewing and Changing the Default Payment Method](#viewing-and-changing-the-default-payment-method) section.

This process does not immediately charge any past due balance on the account to the new card. If you have an outstanding balance, you need to make a manual payment to bring your account up to date. See the [Making a One-Time Payment](#making-a-one-time-payment) section for more information.
