SiteBay strives to provide transparent and uncomplicated pricing structures and billing policies. As a supplement to our [Pricing](https://www.sitebay.org/pricing/) page, read through this guide to understand how we bill for services and how you can pay for these services. For instructions on how to manage your billing in the My SiteBay, see the [Manage Billing in My SiteBay](/docs/products/platform/billing/guides/) guide. If you have a question that isn't answered in either of these guides, don't hesitate to [contact Support](https://www.sitebay.org/docs/).

## Understand How Billing Works

All below prices are in United States Dollars. For EUR and CAD, pricing, refer to our [Pricing](https://www.sitebay.org/pricing/) page.

## Get a Plan

By default, new accounts will be on the free plan. Free plans get one free site. It has limited visits, storage, recordings, and will go to sleep every day. 

## Sleeping sites

Your site will be converted to a simple static site. 

You won't be able to log in to WP admin.

Features that update the database, like contact forms also won't work.  

You can wake your site up from the My SiteBay dashboard.

Upgrade to get sleep immunity and way more visits. If a site exceeds its visits, it will no longer be able to be awoken until next cycle.

## Paid plans

All free plans can be upgraded, with a no risk free trial

## More Info
Here are some important billing considerations:
- Visits/storage are counted hourly
- **Upgrade your free site to a paid and your visits and stuff will instantly reset.** You can cancel any time before your trial ends. You need a payment method like a credit card. 
- We use Stripe Checkout which is convenient. 
- A user can have multiple plans, but only one free site per account which can be on whichever team, even if it’s a paid plan.
- If a plan expires, it will be downgraded to free, but never deleted. A Site  on an expired plan will be converted to free if a user’s free site is available, but deleted if not. 
- You can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel your plan at any time in your Stripe Portal, accessible by clicking Manage Plan in the My SiteBay Dashboard
- If you go over your visits, you can upgrade your plan to instantly get more visits.
- SiteBay uses a monthly billing cycle. An invoice is automatically generated on the cycle reset date that you can find in your Team Settings dashboard. 

\*Review the [Team Settings](/docs/products/platform/billing/guides/access-billing/) section in My SiteBay guide to monitor your visits and storage usage.

### Region Specific Pricing

For now, SiteBay plans and services are billed at the same, flat rate across data centers.

## Payments

When an invoice is generated on the cycle reset date, SiteBay automatically attempts to charge the account's default payment method. In addition to these automatic recurring payments, you can make one-time payments to add funds to your account, which will then be used to pay future invoices.

### Refunds

A refund can be requested for any *positive account balance* (excluding promotion credits). You can also receive a full refund as part of our cancellation policy if you cancel within the first 7 days. To learn more about this cancellation policy, see the [Cancel Your Account](/docs/products/platform/accounts/guides/cancel-account/) guide.

To request a refund, contact the [Support](https://www.sitebay.org/docs/) team with the reason for your request. Refunds can only be considered for payments made within the last 180 days. Once the request is approved, the refund is issued to the original payment method. A $5 processing fee is deducted from all refunds, with the exception of cancelling an account within the first 7 days.
