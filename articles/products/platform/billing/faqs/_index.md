## What happens when I go over my visits or storage?

Your sites are put in sleep mode, and cannot be re-awakened until next month's cycle. 
Grossly going over your storage may result in your resources being deleted.


## Where can I view amount of credit available on my account?

Promotional credits from a promo code are visible on the [Billing Info](https://my.sitebay.org/account/billing) page of the My Site Bay. This credit is listed under the **Promotions** section that is only visible *if a promo code has been applied to your account*. Other types of account credits are displayed on the same page under the **Account Balance section**. A balance that is green indicates the amount of credit on the account. A balance that is red indicates the amount currently past due.

## Will my current credit cover my next invoice?

Any credits on your account, including affiliate, promotional credits and other account credits, are automatically applied to your next invoice. You can verify if your available credits meet your current expenditure by reviewing your [currently accrued charges](/docs/products/platform/billing/guides/access-billing/) and calculating your usage for the remainder of the billing cycle. See the [Pricing](https://www.sitebay.org/pricing/) page for a detailed list of all service fees.


## Can I change my billing date?

Invoices are automatically generated when you buy a plan. While this cannot be changed, you may contact [Support](https://www.sitebay.org/support/) if you would like to be billed more frequently or in smaller increments.

## What are Site Bayâ€™s currently accepted payment methods?

Site Bay partners with Stripe Checkout, which accepts all major credit cards, Google Pay, and other forms of payment. To view a complete list of all accepted payment methods, see [Payment Methods](/docs/products/platform/billing/guides/payment-methods/).

## Why did my card get declined?

A card can be declined for many different reasons. Banks often do not pass along details for declined charges to vendors, like Site Bay. To investigate why your card was declined, contact your bank.

## How do I remove a credit card from my account?

You can manage your payment methods, including credit cards, from the Manage Plan Link on My Site Bay. This will lead you to your Stripe Checkout management page. To learn how to remove a credit card, see [Remove a Payment Method](/docs/products/platform/billing/guides/payment-methods/#remove-a-payment-method). Keep in mind you must have at least one valid payment method on file. If you are attempting to delete your only payment method, you must add a new payment method first.

## Can I make a payment in another currency?

We accept payments in USD, CAD, and EUR. If you wish to pay in another currency, you must use a credit card or other form of payment that can process the currency exchange on your behalf.
