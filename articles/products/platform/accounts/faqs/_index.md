## I no longer remember my user password. How can I reset it?

If you forget the password associated with your SiteBay user account, you can reset it using the [forgot password](https://my.sitebay.org/forgot/password) form. Once you enter your username and submit the form, a password reset is emailed to the user's email address. See [Reset Your User Password](/docs/products/platform/accounts/guides/reset-user-password/).

If you instead need assistance resetting the admin user on a WordPress Site, use the wp-cli in code-server.

## I'm not receiving password reset emails.

Login-related emails are sent to the email address of your user account (not to the billing contact email) and are sent from *support@sitebay.org*. If you are expecting a password reset email but not seeing one in your inbox, follow the steps below:

- Check your spam or junk folder for the email.
- Search your inbox for the sender email (*support@sitebay.org*).
- If you are using a Microsoft email service (like Outlook.com, Microsoft 365, or Exchange), verify that *sitebay.org* is on the [safe senders list](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/block-or-allow-junk-email-settings-48c9f6f7-2309-4f95-9a4d-de987e880e46#bkmk_safesenders).
- For Microsoft 365: review your [quarantined email messages](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/quarantine-end-user). When viewing the [quarantine portal](https://protection.office.com/quarantine), search for your email address, locate the email you wish to receive, and release/allow that email. and release any emails from *sitebay.org*.
