## I no longer remember my user password. How can I reset it?

If you forget the password associated with your Site Bay user account, you can reset it using the [forgot password](https://my.sitebay.org/forgot/password) form. Once you enter your username and submit the form, a password reset is emailed to the user's email address. See [Reset Your User Password](/docs/products/platform/accounts/guides/reset-user-password/).

If you instead need assistance resetting the root user on a WordPress Site, review the [Reset the Root Password on a WordPress Site](/docs/products/compute/wordpress-sites/guides/reset-root-password/) guide.

## I'm not receiving password reset emails.

Login-related emails are sent to the email address of your user account (not to the billing contact email) and are sent from *support@sitebay.org*. If you are expecting a password reset email but not seeing one in your inbox, follow the steps below:

- Check your spam or junk folder for the email.
- Search your inbox for the sender email (*support@sitebay.org*).
- If you are using a Microsoft email service (like Outlook.com, Microsoft 365, or Exchange), verify that *sitebay.org* is on the [safe senders list](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/block-or-allow-junk-email-settings-48c9f6f7-2309-4f95-9a4d-de987e880e46#bkmk_safesenders).
- For Microsoft 365: review your [quarantined email messages](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/quarantine-end-user). When viewing the [quarantine portal](https://protection.office.com/quarantine), search for your email address, locate the email you wish to receive, and release/allow that email. and release any emails from *sitebay.org*.

## 2FA is enabled on my account but I no longer have access to my 2FA device or application. How can I regain access to my Site Bay account?

2FA (two-factor authentication) adds a layer of security to protect your account from unauthorized access. When switching devices or 2FA applications, it's important to [reset 2FA](/docs/products/platform/accounts/guides/2fa/#switching-to-a-new-device-or-2fa-provider) before decommissioning your original device. If you lose access to your device before resetting 2FA, use one of the scratch codes that were provided to when 2FA was first enabled. As a best practice, these should always be stored in a secure manner separate from your 2FA provider. If you do not have your scratch code, review the options available within the [2FA Recovery Procedures](/docs/products/platform/accounts/guides/2fa/#recovery-procedure).
