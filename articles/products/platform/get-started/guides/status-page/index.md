The [Status Page](https://status.sitebay.org/) provides real-time system status and maintenance updates via email. All customers are encouraged to subscribe to status notifications to stay up-to-date with any events that may impact our services. When you sign up for status updates, you can fine-tune which service updates you receive. These different topic areas are referred to as *components*. If, for example, all your services are restricted to the Newark data center, you may only wish to subscribe to the Newark component.

You can also subscribe to individual incident notifications. In this case, you can be notified of new updates to an incident via email or SMS.
