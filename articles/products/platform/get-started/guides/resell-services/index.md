## Referral Program

As an alternative to reselling our services, you can participate in our referral program. See the [Referral Program](https://www.sitebay.org/referral-program/) page on our website or the [Referral Program](/docs/products/platform/billing/guides/referral-program/) section within our billing guide for more details.

Advertising your referral code to others is not the same as reselling SiteBay services. When someone else uses your referral code, they create an entirely separate SiteBay account with their own billing.

## Things Resellers Should Keep in Mind

There are a few stipulations that resellers should keep in mind:

- All resellers, and the customers of resellers, are bound to [SiteBay's Terms of Service](https://www.sitebay.org/tos) (ToS). If for any reason a customer of a SiteBay reseller breaks SiteBay's ToS, it is the reseller who will be held accountable. If you are planning on becoming a reseller it is a good idea to carefully craft a ToS of your own that is in accordance with SiteBay's ToS.

- All resellers, and the customers of resellers, are bound to [SiteBay's Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.sitebay.org/aup) (AUP). If for any reason a customer of a SiteBay reseller breaks SiteBay's AUP, it is the reseller who will be held accountable.

- Payments are to be made directly to SiteBay by the reseller. If a customer of a reseller fails to pay the reseller for their services, the reseller is still responsible for their monthly payment to SiteBay.

- SiteBay Support can help with issues related to the physical operation of your SiteBay services, but issues related to your software configuration are outside of the [scope of SiteBay Support](/docs/products/platform/get-started/guides/support/#scope-of-support). SiteBay offers a number of [resources](/docs/products/platform/get-started/guides/support/#resources) to help with configuration questions. SiteBay Support is only available to people with access to a [My SiteBay user](#limited-cloud-manager-user). If your customers do not have their own SiteBay users, they will not be able to contact SiteBay Support.

### SiteBay API

The best way to resell SiteBay services is through the use of the SiteBay API. The SiteBay API provides robust, programmatic access to the full suite of SiteBay services. Using the API, a reseller could set up a custom user interface to only allow the select features they want available for their customers. For a tutorial on how to use the SiteBay API, check out our [Getting Started with the SiteBay API](/docs/products/tools/api/get-started/) guide. For a comprehensive view of the SiteBay API, see SiteBay's [API documentation](/docs/api/). For a list of SiteBay API libraries and tools, head over to our [developer portal](https://developers.sitebay.org/libraries-tools/).
