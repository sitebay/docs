## Referral Program

As an alternative to reselling our services, you can participate in our referral program. See the [Referral Program](https://www.sitebay.org/referral-program/) page on our website or the [Referral Program](/docs/products/platform/billing/guides/referral-program/) section within our billing guide for more details.

Advertising your referral code to others is not the same as reselling Site Bay services. When someone else uses your referral code, they create an entirely separate Site Bay account with their own billing.

## Things Resellers Should Keep in Mind

There are a few stipulations that resellers should keep in mind:

- All resellers, and the customers of resellers, are bound to [Site Bay's Terms of Service](https://www.sitebay.org/tos) (ToS). If for any reason a customer of a Site Bay reseller breaks Site Bay's ToS, it is the reseller who will be held accountable. If you are planning on becoming a reseller it is a good idea to carefully craft a ToS of your own that is in accordance with Site Bay's ToS.

- All resellers, and the customers of resellers, are bound to [Site Bay's Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.sitebay.org/aup) (AUP). If for any reason a customer of a Site Bay reseller breaks Site Bay's AUP, it is the reseller who will be held accountable.

- Payments are to be made directly to Site Bay by the reseller. If a customer of a reseller fails to pay the reseller for their services, the reseller is still responsible for their monthly payment to Site Bay.

- Site Bay Support can help with issues related to the physical operation of your Site Bay services, but issues related to your software configuration are outside of the [scope of Site Bay Support](/docs/products/platform/get-started/guides/support/#scope-of-support). Site Bay offers a number of [resources](/docs/products/platform/get-started/guides/support/#resources) to help with configuration questions. Site Bay Support is only available to people with access to a [My Site Bay user](#limited-cloud-manager-user). If your customers do not have their own Site Bay users, they will not be able to contact Site Bay Support.

### Site Bay API

The best way to resell Site Bay services is through the use of the Site Bay API. The Site Bay API provides robust, programmatic access to the full suite of Site Bay services. Using the API, a reseller could set up a custom user interface to only allow the select features they want available for their customers. For a tutorial on how to use the Site Bay API, check out our [Getting Started with the Site Bay API](/docs/products/tools/api/get-started/) guide. For a comprehensive view of the Site Bay API, see Site Bay's [API documentation](/docs/api/). For a list of Site Bay API libraries and tools, head over to our [developer portal](https://developers.sitebay.org/libraries-tools/).
