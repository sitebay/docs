## Overview

**Network transfer** is the exchange of data between two computers over the public internet or a private network. Other providers and publications may also refer to this as data transfer, ingress/egress, and bandwidth.

This traffic is broken down into inbound (ingress) and outbound (egress) network transfer. *Inbound network transfer* is data sent *to* your service, such as a file upload. *Outbound network transfer* is data sent *from* your service, such as a web page and its images, stylesheets, and JavaScript files.

## Transfer Allowance

The following SiteBay services consume network transfer and, in most cases, include a set amount of outbound network transfer allowance per month. The amount of transfer is displayed along with the pricing and plan details for each service. See SiteBay's [pricing page](https://www.sitebay.org/pricing) for exact amounts.

- **WordPress Sites:** Consume network transfer and include 1-20 TB of transfer allowance per month, depending on plan size.
