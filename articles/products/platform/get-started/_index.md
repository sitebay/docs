## Sign Up for an Account

First, you need to create a Site Bay account to start using our services. If you already have a Site Bay account, you can skip to the next section.

1.  Open a web browser and navigate to [my.sitebay.org/signup](https://my.sitebay.org/signup). If you are not already logged in to an account, the **Create an Account** form is displayed.

1.  Enter your email address, a unique username, and a strong password. Alternatively, you can sign up using your existing Google or GitHub account. When using another provider, you are prompted for a username in a separate step.

1.  A confirmation email is sent to your email address shortly after. Click the link in that email to confirm your email address.

1.  In the **Security** section of the signup process, input your phone number. Site Bay uses phone numbers as a measure to verify identity and prevent fraud. Once a phone number is provided, a verification code is sent to that number as an SMS text message. Enter this code into the signup form.

    {{< note >}}
    This phone number provides our team with a secure method of verifying your identity as the owner of the newly created Site Bay user account. We will only ever use this phone number to verify your identity by sending a verification code as an SMS message. See [Phone Verification](/docs/products/platform/accounts/guides/user-security-controls/#phone-verification) for more details.

1.  Within the **Billing** section, select your payment method and enter your billing address details. Site Bay accepts credit/debit cards, and Google Pay. See the [Billing and Payments](/docs/products/platform/billing/#payments) guide to learn more about each of these methods. You must also accept the [Master Services Agreement](https://www.sitebay.org/legal/).

1.  Most accounts are activated instantly and you can start adding services right away. A small number of accounts may require manual review prior to activation.



## Navigate the Site Bay



## Understand Billing

Site Bay services are billed to your primary payment method at your cycle reset date

- [Billing and Payments](/docs/products/platform/billing/)
- [Managing Billing in the My Site Bay](/docs/products/platform/billing/guides/)
- [Site Bay Price List](https://www.sitebay.org/pricing/)

Keep in mind that charges will accrue for any active service, even if it is powered off or otherwise not in use. This includes WordPress Sites that have been powered off as well as any service you might have added to the account but are not using.

## Explore Site Bay Guides

Site Bay offers extensive documentation. This not only includes guides for our core products and services, but general guides on Linux, the command-line, networking, security, version control, databases, and *much* more. Learn how to deploy a WordPress One-Click App, run a VPN, install a file storage platform, or even host a website using Object Storage. Whatever cloud computing use cases you have in mind, you can likely do it on Site Bay and our guides are a great place to start.
