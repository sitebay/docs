# My SiteBay WordPress Hosting Site Tools

## Optimize Your Site with External Paths

SiteBay Tools offer an impressive feature known as "External Paths." This function, primarily used to optimize search engine operations, lets users connect their external websites to a particular pathway or URL. 

The docs site you're on now is hosted on GitHub for free and then linked to our dogfooded site www.sitebay.org at /docs using this method. this feature enables website owners to link their docs site to their main website. Simply input the URL of your external site (like www.sitebay.org/docs), and identify a path (like /docs). Now, your docs site is accessible via www.sitebay.org/docs.

This feature enhances your SEO strategy, making your content more accessible to search engines so it improves your websites visibility.

## Secure Your Website with HTTP Basic Authentication

Security is paramount for any website. SiteBay Tools help the user protect their website with HTTP basic authentication. With this feature, access to your site requires a username and password, making your website private and secure.

Once set, your site will be under the protection of HTTP Basic Authentication, accessible only with your unique credentials.
## Domain Change
Change your domain in a click, no fuss. Remember to set up your new domains CNAME properly before.

## Delete site
In the danger zone, you can delete your site.

## Development Mode and Cache Management

To avoid delays in seeing your website changes, SiteBay provides an option to enable "Development Mode." This feature allows you to bypass Cloudflare's cache, enabling immediate viewing of your website changes. 

"Clear Cache" forces Cloudflare to update your site's cache, retrieving the most recent files.
