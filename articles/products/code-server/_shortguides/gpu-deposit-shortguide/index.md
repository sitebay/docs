{{< note >}}
In some cases, a $100 deposit may be required to deploy GPU Code Server Instances. This may include new accounts that have been active for less than 90 days and accounts that have spent less than $100 on SiteBay services. If you are unable to deploy GPU instances, contact [Support](https://www.sitebay.org/docs/) for assistance.
