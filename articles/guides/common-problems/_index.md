Welcome to the WordPress troubleshooting guide by Site Bay! If you've hit a snag with your WordPress site, don't sweat it. This guide is packed with easy-to-follow solutions for the most common WordPress headaches. Whether you're dealing with a pesky plugin, a slow site, or you just can't get your head around customizing your theme, we've got you covered.

Common WordPress Problems & How to Fix 'Em:
1. White Screen of Death (WSOD)

Ever hit refresh and your site just goes blank? Chill, it's often an easy fix. Usually, it's a rogue plugin or theme causing trouble. Try disabling your plugins one by one to see which one is the troublemaker, or switch to a default theme to check if that solves it.

2. Login Issues

Locked out? First, try resetting your password. No dice? There might be a problem with your wp-login.php file or your site's .htaccess file. Check through FTP to see if everything's in order.

3. Slow Loading Times

If your site's moving like molasses, it might be time to optimize. Compress those images, cache your pages, and consider upgrading your Site Bay plan for more horsepower.

4. Error Establishing a Database Connection

This scary message usually means WordPress can't connect to your site's database. Double-check your wp-config.php file for the correct database info. If everything looks good, hit up Site Bay support – we're here to help.

5. Updates Gone Wrong

Tried to update WordPress or a plugin and now things are wonky? Roll back to a previous point using Site Bay's Time Machine, then try updating one more time. If it keeps freaking out, that plugin or theme might not be compatible with your version of WordPress.

6. Permalinks Not Working

Getting 404 errors on your pages? Head to Settings > Permalinks in your WordPress dashboard and hit save without changing anything. This usually resets the permalinks and gets things back on track.

Got a problem that's not on the list? Reach out to us at support@sitebay.org. We're here to help you get back to doing what you love – creating awesome content for your site.
