Introduction to Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a powerful open-source system for managing containerized applications across a cluster of machines. It provides tools for deploying applications, scaling them as necessary, managing changes to existing containerized applications, and optimizing the use of underlying hardware beneath your containers. SiteBay streamlines this process for WordPress hosting, providing an optimized environment for deploying, managing, and scaling your WordPress sites.

Quick Start with Kubernetes on SiteBay

Setting up Kubernetes for your WordPress site on SiteBay is fast and straightforward:

Sign Up and Set Up: First things first, sign up for SiteBay and set up your account. You'll need this to create and manage your Kubernetes clusters.

Create Your Kubernetes Cluster: Utilize the SiteBay dashboard to easily create a Kubernetes cluster. Select the region that's closest to your audience for better performance.

Deploy WordPress with NGINX: Deploy your WordPress site using NGINX within the Kubernetes cluster. SiteBay's integration with Helm charts makes this process a breeze, automating the deployment and management of your WordPress site's components.

Configure Your Environment: With SiteBay, configuring your WordPress environment is simple. You can set up domain names, SSL certificates, and access controls without the hassle.

Deploying NGINX on Kubernetes

NGINX is renowned for its high performance, stability, rich feature set, simple configuration, and low resource consumption. Hereâ€™s how to deploy NGINX on your Kubernetes cluster in SiteBay:

Prepare Your Configuration: Start by creating a deployment YAML file for NGINX. This file describes your NGINX deployment's desired state, including the number of replicas, container image to use, and more.

Deploy NGINX: Use the kubectl apply command to deploy NGINX using your YAML file. This tells Kubernetes to create the deployment as described in your file.

Verify the Deployment: Check the status of your deployment with kubectl get deployments. You should see your NGINX deployment listed, indicating it's up and running.

Access Your NGINX Application: Once deployed, you can access your NGINX application through the service you've configured in Kubernetes. This might be a LoadBalancer service that exposes your NGINX deployment to the internet.
