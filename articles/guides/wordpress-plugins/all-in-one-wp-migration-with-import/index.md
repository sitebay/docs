Restoring your WordPress site on SiteBay can be smooth and straightforward, especially when you're using the All-in-One WP Migration plugin. This tool simplifies the process of migrating your WordPress website, regardless of its size. Here’s how to get your site back up and running in no time.

Before You Begin
Install the Plugin: Ensure that the All-in-One WP Migration plugin is installed and activated on your WordPress dashboard.
Download Your Backup: Have your WordPress site backup ready. This backup should have been created using the All-in-One WP Migration plugin.
Restoring Your Site
Access All-in-One WP Migration: From your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the All-in-One WP Migration plugin, then select "Import".
Upload Your Backup: Click on "Import From" > "File" and select your backup file. The plugin supports various file types, including .wpress which is the default format for All-in-One WP Migration backups.
Wait for the Upload: Depending on your file size and internet speed, this step may take some time. The plugin will keep you posted on the progress.
Perform the Restoration: Once the upload is complete, the plugin will automatically start restoring your site from the backup. This includes your database, media files, plugins, and themes.
Complete the Process: After the restoration is finished, you might be prompted to save your permalink structure. Simply follow the link provided by the plugin to ensure your site’s URLs work correctly.
After Restoration
Check Your Site: Go through your site to make sure everything is in place and working as expected.
Update Your Passwords: For security reasons, it’s a good idea to change your WordPress admin password after restoring your site.
Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the import size limit:

The plugin’s standard version has a size limit for the import. If your backup exceeds this limit, you might need the premium version.
Alternatively, you can use the "All-in-One WP Migration File Extension" to increase the upload size limit.
Conclusion

All-in-One WP Migration is a powerful tool for restoring your WordPress site on SiteBay, making it a straightforward process to get your site back to its former glory. With this guide, you're well-equipped to handle site restorations like a pro.
