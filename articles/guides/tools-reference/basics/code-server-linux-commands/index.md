We're here to turn you into a command line ninja, managing your WordPress site like you were born to do it.

## The Heart of Your Site: Understanding Linux File System

In the world of Site Bay, your WordPress site lives in a Linux-powered environment. 
- /bin: Your toolbox, filled with essential programs.
- /etc: The settings corner, housing configuration files.
- /home: Where user folders reside, including your site's specific workspace.
- /var: The dynamic area, storing content that changes over time, like logs.
Navigating the Linux Jungle with ls

The ls command is your flashlight, revealing the contents of the Linux file jungle. Want to peek into a directory? Just ls it. Looking for hidden treasures? ls -a unveils files shyly starting with a ..

Getting Detailed with ls -l

Crave more details about your files? ls -l lays them all out, from permissions to sizes, making it easier to manage your WordPress assets.

Moving Around with cd

Feeling adventurous? The cd command moves you through the directories, exploring different parts of your site's file system. Jump back with cd .. or head straight home with cd ~.

Copying and Renaming with cp and mv

Need duplicates of your files or want to move them around? The cp and mv commands are your best pals. Copy files with cp for backups or use mv to rename them, keeping your site organized.

Creating New Chapters with touch and mkdir

Ready to add new content? touch creates a blank page for your next masterpiece, while mkdir builds a new shelf (directory) for your expanding library.

Tidying Up with rm and rmdir

All good things must come to an end, and sometimes that means saying goodbye to files and directories. Use rm for files or rmdir for those empty directories. Just be cautious â€“ there's no undo button here.
