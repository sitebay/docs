{{< note type="warning" title="Email restrictions on SiteBay WordPress Hosting" >}}
To combat spam from our network, outbound connections on ports 25, 465, and 587 are restricted by default for some new accounts. This measure aims to prevent misuse of our services for spamming. If you need to send emails from your WordPress hosting environment, we advise checking our Email Policy and Setup guide for detailed instructions on compliant email practices and how to request lifting these port restrictions.
