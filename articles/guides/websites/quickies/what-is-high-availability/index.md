## What is High Availability?

Ever wonder why some websites are almost always up, no matter what? That's 'cause they're rocking something called High Availability (HA). It's like having a backup plan for your backup plan, making sure the site or app keeps rolling no matter what.

HA's all about keeping your digital spot open for business 24/7, avoiding those awkward "Sorry, we're closed" moments online. It's like a team of superheroes, where if one hero gets tired, another jumps in to keep saving the day. No single hero's nap time puts the city—ahem, your site—at risk.

## What High Availability Isn't

High Availability doesn't mean your site's invincible. It's got a fancy goal of staying awake 99.999% of the time, but hey, nothing's perfect. What it does mean is that your site's built tough, ready to handle crowds without breaking a sweat.

And when more folks show up wanting to check you out, HA systems can stretch out to serve everyone. It's like adding more lanes to a highway during rush hour. More space, less wait, everybody's happy.

So, that's the deal with High Availability. It's your website's way of saying, "Come on in, we're always open," making sure visitors can always find what they need, whenever they need it.
