title: Set up a Subdomain or Path for your WordPress Site
---

Got a WordPress site and looking to jazz it up with a special section like a blog or an e-shop? A subdomain might just be your ticket to cool town. It's like giving a VIP pass to a part of your site, with its very own name on the list. Say your site is "example.com"; slap a subdomain on it, and you've got "blog.example.com" for all your storytelling needs.

Why Go for a Subdomain?
Keep Things Tidy: Separate your main site from your extras—like a blog or shop—to help your visitors find what they need without getting lost in the sauce.
Customize Like a Pro: Want a killer look for your store or a unique vibe for your blog? Subdomains let you tweak design and functionality separately from the rest of your site.
Boost Your SEO Game: Subdomains can help you climb the search engine ranks by focusing on specific topics or keywords. It's like getting a leg up in the internet popularity contest.
Setting Up Your Subdomain

Here’s a step-by-step to get your subdomain live:

Get into Your Hosting Account: Jump into your SiteBay dashboard and find the "Domains" section.
Create Your Subdomain: Hit "Add Subdomain" and name it. Going for a blog? Try "blog.yoursite.com".
Point It Right: Set up the DNS settings to point your new subdomain to the right place in the digital universe.
Install WordPress (Again?): If you're using SiteBay, you can easily add a new WordPress instance to your subdomain. It's like setting up your main site, but this time it's for your subdomain's exclusive bash.
Theme It Up: Customize your subdomain's look to match its purpose. Different vibe for the blog? No problem.
Launch: Double-check everything, and when you're ready, take that subdomain live!

Creating a subdomain is like giving a piece of your website its own identity and room to shine. Whether it's for selling swag, sharing stories, or showcasing your portfolio, a subdomain can make it stand out. So go ahead, give your WordPress site that extra flair with a subdomain!
