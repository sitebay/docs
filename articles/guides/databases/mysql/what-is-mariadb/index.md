# What Makes MariaDB Different From MySQL?

Understanding the difference between MariaDB and MySQL: We will break it down for you as simply as possible.

## Understanding Databases

First, it's crucial to understand that both MariaDB and MySQL are types of databases. A database is just a place where information is stored and organized. It's a lot like keeping your clothes sorted in specific drawers, so you know exactly where to find a particular shirt or pair of pants.

## MySQL

MySQL is a popular database system. It's been around since 1995, which in tech years, basically means it's as classic as a pair of well-broken-in jeans.

Many websites use MySQL to manage information. So, when you make an online purchase, there's a good chance the store is using MySQL to keep track of what you're buying and how much it costs.

## MariaDB

MariaDB on the other hand, is newer and grew out of MySQL. Think of it like a sibling. 

A group of original developers from MySQL created MariaDB in 2009. They designed this new system to be more advanced, improved performance, and added some additional features. 

## MariaDB vs MySQL: The Differences

Now you're probably thinking, "If MariaDB is a better version of MySQL, why doesn't everyone use it?" Which is a totally fair question.

Yes, MariaDB tends to be a little more advanced, and it often gets updates and new features faster. But the truth is, for most common uses, the differences between MariaDB and MySQL aren't that big. 

Choosing between the two is like choosing between a basic, reliable tool and a fancier version with more bells and whistles. Each one works, but the choice depends on what you're comfortable with and what you need for your particular tasks.

## Conclusion

I hope this helps you understand the difference between MariaDB and MySQL. Remember, they're both good tools, each with their own pros and cons. It's all about finding what works best for you and your needs.
