Got a SiteBay WordPress site and thinking about adding a Shopify store to it? 
Smart move for selling your stuff with the SEO of a WordPress blog. You also get all the PostHog stuff like session recordings and event logging.

Shopify's got a feature called the "Buy Button" but it isn't as good for SEO because your blog and shopify are on two different sites. 

## Step 1: Get Your Shopify Store Ready

First things first, you gotta have a Shopify store. If you don't, head over to Shopify and set one up. It's like setting up your own corner of the online market where you can showcase your goods.

## Step 2: Install our Shopify app

Log into your Shopify admin.
Go to the "Sales Channels" section, and install our SiteBay WordPress app.
You will be redirected to the Shopify Link page on My SiteBay where you can link an existing SiteBay WordPress site, and boom: You now have a blog accessible at /a/blog and session recordings and surveys and advanced analytics.
