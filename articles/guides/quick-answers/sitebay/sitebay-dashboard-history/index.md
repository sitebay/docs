Managing your WordPress site involves keeping track of changes and being able to revert to previous states when necessary. SiteBay's dashboard offers a comprehensive view of your site's history, including updates, modifications, and other events. This guide will introduce you to navigating your site's history and utilizing the Point-in-Time (PIT) machine for site restoration on SiteBay.

## Accessing Your Site's History

SiteBay's dashboard provides a detailed log of your site's activities, allowing you to monitor changes and identify when specific updates were made. Here's how to access it:

Log into your SiteBay dashboard.
Navigate to the "History" or "Activity Log" section.
Here, you'll see a chronological list of events, including site updates, plugin installations, content changes, and more.

## Restoring Your Site with the PIT Machine

Mistakes happen, and sometimes you need to roll back your site to a previous state. SiteBay's PIT machine makes this process straightforward:

In the SiteBay dashboard, locate the "Restoration" or "PIT Machine" section.
Select the date and time you want to restore your site to. This can be based on a specific event or update from your site's history.
Confirm the restoration. SiteBay will revert your site to the selected state, preserving your data up to that point.

## Tips 
Utilize Staging Environments: Before making changes, use a staging site to test updates. This can prevent the need for restorations. You can even make a stage from a past point-in-time, down to the minute.
