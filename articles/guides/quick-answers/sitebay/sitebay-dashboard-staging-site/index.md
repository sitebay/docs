Creating a staging site on SiteBay's WordPress hosting platform is a breeze, thanks to Kubernetes’ robust architecture and the integrated analytics and monitoring tools like PostHog and Grafana. Staging sites are essential for testing updates, themes, plugins, and custom code before pushing changes to your live WordPress site, ensuring a smooth visitor experience.

In this guide, we’ll walk through the steps to set up and manage a staging site on SiteBay, using the dashboard for an intuitive user experience.

Getting Started with Staging Sites

Staging sites mirror your live WordPress site, serving as a safe testing ground for all changes. Here’s how you can set up a staging environment on SiteBay:

Access Your SiteBay Dashboard: Log in to your SiteBay dashboard to manage your WordPress hosting settings.
Create a Staging Site: Look for the “Staging” option within the dashboard. With a simple click, you can initiate the creation of a staging environment that’s an exact replica of your live site.
Utilize PostHog and Grafana: Monitor the performance and user interaction on your staging site using PostHog analytics directly integrated into your SiteBay dashboard. Access Grafana dashboards for detailed site metrics and performance insights.
Managing Your Staging Site

With your staging site up and running, here’s how to make the most of it:

Test Updates and Changes: Implement any planned updates, including WordPress core updates, plugin installations, theme changes, or custom code modifications.
