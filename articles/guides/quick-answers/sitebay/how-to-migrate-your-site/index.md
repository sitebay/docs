Migrating your site

Ready to move your site to SiteBay? Don't sweat it. It's simpler than you think. Here’s the play-by-play on getting your WordPress site to its new home with us.

Step 1: Sign Up and Set Up

First things first, you gotta sign up with SiteBay. Once you’ve got your account, go ahead and set up a new site. We’ll walk you through it, step by step.

Step 2: Grab Your Stuff

Now, let's pack up your site. You can use plugins like All-in-One WP Migration or Duplicator to make a copy of your site’s files and database. These tools are pretty straightforward and will zip everything up for you.

Step 3: Unpack at SiteBay

Got your site all zipped up? Great. Next, upload that package to your SiteBay site. If you're using a migration plugin, it often comes with an import feature that lets you upload your site directly. Or, you can manually upload your files through SFTP and import your database via phpMyAdmin.

Step 4: Do a Test Run

Before you flip the switch, take a moment to make sure everything on your new SiteBay site is looking good. Check your pages, links, images – the works.

Step 5: Switch Your DNS

This part's important. You'll need to update your domain's DNS settings to point to SiteBay. This tells the internet where your site lives now. It might take a bit for the changes to spread out across the web, so give it a little time.

Step 6: Say Goodbye to Your Old Site

Once everything’s shiny on your SiteBay site and you’re happy with how things are running, you can safely shut down your old site. Don’t rush it, though. Make sure everything’s smooth on our end first.

And there you have it – you’ve migrated your WordPress site to SiteBay! If you hit any bumps along the way or just have some questions, reach out to us at support@sitebay.org. Welcome aboard!
