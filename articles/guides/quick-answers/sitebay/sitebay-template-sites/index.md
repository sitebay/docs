Introduction to Site Bay's WordPress Hosting

Site Bay revolutionizes WordPress hosting by harnessing the power of Kubernetes, paired with cutting-edge tools like PostHog for analytics and Grafana for dashboard visualization. This guide walks you through the key features that set Site Bay apart, ensuring your WordPress sites are not just hosted but optimized, monitored, and scalable.

PostHog Analytics: Understanding Your Audience

PostHog offers comprehensive analytics, giving you a deeper understanding of your website's visitors. From tracking page views to monitoring user interactions, PostHog helps you make data-driven decisions to enhance your site's user experience and content strategy.

Key Benefits:
- Session recordings: Track how users navigate through your site to identify popular content and potential bottlenecks.
- Event Tracking: Monitor specific actions on your site, such as button clicks and form submissions, to understand user behavior better.
- Grafana Dashboards: Monitoring Performance and Traffic

Grafana provides customizable dashboards to monitor your WordPress site's performance and traffic. With Grafana, you get real-time insights into your website's health, including response times, server load, and visitor statistics.

Key Features:
- Custom Dashboards: Tailor your monitoring dashboard to focus on the metrics that matter most to your site.
- Alerting: Receive notifications about changes or issues on your site, ensuring you can respond promptly to any situation.
- Data Sources: Integrate data from multiple sources, including PostHog and your server logs, for a comprehensive overview of your site's performance.

Site Bay's use of Kubernetes ensures your WordPress sites are scalable and resilient. Kubernetes automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications, making it easier to handle traffic spikes and maintain uptime.

Advantages:
- Automatic Scaling: Kubernetes adjusts resources allocated to your site based on traffic, ensuring smooth performance during peak times.
- High Availability: With Kubernetes, your site is distributed across multiple servers, reducing the risk of downtime due to server failure.
