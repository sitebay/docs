Site Bay's Dashboard is packed with powerful tools designed to give you full control over your WordPress hosting environment. These tools are tailored to streamline your site management process, ensuring that your website remains robust, secure, and highly available. Let's dive into what each tool offers and how you can use them to enhance your site's performance.

## External Paths

Integrate external support sites into your main website for improved SEO. This feature allows you to make documentation or support content available on your main domain, such as www.yoursite.com/support, enhancing user experience and site cohesion.

## HTTP Basic Authentication

Protect your site with HTTP Basic Authentication, requiring a username and password for access. This layer of security is crucial for keeping your site private during development or when you need to restrict access to certain parts of your site.

## Change Domain

Easily change your site's domain name. Whether you're rebranding or moving to a new domain, this tool simplifies the process, ensuring that your transition is as smooth as possible.

## Delete Site

When it's time to remove a site, whether for cleanup or because a project has come to an end, this tool enables you to do so directly from the dashboard. It ensures that your site is properly and securely deleted from the server.

Utilizing these dashboard tools effectively can greatly enhance your site management workflow on Site Bay. From security features like HTTP Basic Authentication to performance optimizations such as clearing the cache or using Cloudflare Developer Mode, each tool is designed to provide you with a seamless and efficient hosting experience.

## Testing sites
### Cloudflare Developer Mode

Activate Cloudflare Developer Mode directly from the dashboard to temporarily bypass the cache. This is incredibly useful when making changes to your site that you want to see immediately without waiting for cached content to refresh.

### Clear Cache

Effortlessly clear your site's cache from the dashboard. This is essential for ensuring that your visitors see the most recent version of your site, especially after making updates or changes to your content.
