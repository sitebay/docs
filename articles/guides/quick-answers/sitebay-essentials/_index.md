Whether you're a newbie or a seasoned pro, understanding the foundational aspects of your hosting environment is crucial. Let's dive into the essentials of managing your WordPress sites on SiteBay.

WordPress on Kubernetes

Kubernetes orchestrates your WordPress containers, ensuring they run smoothly, scale quickly, and recover automatically from failures. This means your WordPress sites are more resilient, handling unexpected traffic surges with ease. With SiteBay, you get the power of Kubernetes without the complexity, allowing you to focus on creating stellar content rather than managing infrastructure.

Get insights into how visitors navigate your site and use this data to optimize your content and marketing strategies.

Monitoring with Grafana

SiteBay provides Grafana dashboards, giving you a visual overview of your site's performance metrics, including traffic patterns, resource usage, and response times. This visibility helps you make informed decisions about scaling, optimizing, and troubleshooting your WordPress sites, ensuring they perform optimally at all times.
