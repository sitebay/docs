In the digital world, data is your most valuable asset. Whether it's website content, customer information, or personal projects, losing data can range from inconvenient to catastrophic. Unlike some platforms that automatically back up your data, Site Bay empowers you with full control over your WordPress site's data.

The good news? Site Bay makes this easy with the PIT (Point-In-Time) Machine, a tool designed to safeguard your data by capturing snapshots of your entire site's database every minute. And wp-content data every hour.

## Site Bay's Point-in-Time Machine

Imagine having the ability to turn back time on your websiteâ€”to a point before a mishap occurred. That's what the PIT Machine offers. It's a comprehensive backup solution that:

- Automatically backs up of your entire site, including files and database tables.
- Allows you to restore your site to any previous state captured in a snapshot, effectively undoing any data loss or corruption.
